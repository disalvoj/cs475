This package uses run_prog3.py to compile and run program3.cpp using different 
numbers of threads and padding. run_prog3.py is written in python3, so all you 
have to do to run the program is type the command

	python3 run_prog3.py

at the prompt. The program will run for quite a while (perhaps a few hours) 
depending on your environment. All data will be written out to 'data.csv', 
which will be cat-ed out to the terminal when the program finishes.
