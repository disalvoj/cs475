This package uses run_prog5.py to compile and run program5.cpp using different 
array sizes. It tests SIMD SSE multiplication versus normal C++ multiplication, 
and then SIMD SSE multiplication and reduction versus normal C++ multiplication 
and reduction. To run, simply use the command

	python3 run_prog3.py

at the prompt. All data will be written out to 'data.csv', which will be cat-ed 
out to the terminal when the program finishes.
